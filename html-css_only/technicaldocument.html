              At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside.<br> Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary <br> prerequisites, so let's dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning, modern layout tools <br> like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.

            <ul>
              <li>
                This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules,<br> such as different display values, as well as introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.

          <article>
            <p>
              Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it appears in the source code, with elements stacked <br> on top of one another — the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list, followed by the second paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
              The elements that appear one below the other are described as block elements, in contrast to inline elements,<br> which appear beside one another like the individual words in a paragraph.

        <section class="main-section" id="Flexbox">
          <header>Flexbox</header>
          <article>
            Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout CSS module, designed to make it easy for us to lay things <br> out in one dimension — either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply display: flex to the parent element <br> of the elements you want to lay out; all its direct children then become flex items. We can see this in a simple example.<br>
            <code>
              .main-section {
        display: flex;
      }
            </code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Grids">
          <header>Grids</header>
          <p>
            While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, Grid Layout is designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to flexbox, we enable Grid Layout with its specific display value — display: grid. The below example uses similar markup to the flex  <br> example, with a container and some child elements. In addition to using display: grid, we also define some row and column tracks for the <br> parent using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows"> grid-template-rows</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns">grid-template-columns</a> properties respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've defined three columns, each of 1fr, as well as two rows of 100px. We dont need to put any rules on the child elements; they're <br> automatically placed into the cells our grid's created.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Floats">
          <header>Floats</header>
          <article>
            Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow.<br> The floated element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around it.
            <p>
              The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float">float</a> property has four possible values:
            </p>
            <p>
              Positioning allows you to move an element from where it would otherwise be placed in normal flow over to another location.<br> Positioning isnt a method for creating the main layouts of a page; it's more about managing and fine-tuning the position of specific items on a page.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>
                .main-section {
          float: left;
          width: 150px;
          height: 150px;
          margin-right: 30px;
      }
              </code>
            </p>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Positioning">
          <header>Positioning</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              Positioning allows you to move an element from where it would otherwise be placed in normal flow over to another location.<br> Positioning isnt a method for creating the main layouts of a page; it more about managing and fine-tuning the position of <br> specific items on a page.
            </p>
            <p>
              To provide familiarity with these page layout techniques, we'll show you a couple of quick examples. Our examples will all <br> feature the same HTML structure (a heading followed by three paragraphs), which is as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
              body {
        width: 500px;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
            </code>
            <p>
              This HTML will be styled by default using the following CSS:
            </p>
            <code>
              p {
          background-color: rgb(207,232,220);
          border: 2px solid rgb(79,185,227);
          padding: 10px;
          margin: 10px;
          border-radius: 5px;
      }
            </code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Multiple_column_Layout"><header>Multiple Column Layout</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              The multi-column layout CSS module provides us a way to lay out content in columns, similar to how text flows in a newspaper.<br> While reading up and down columns is less useful in a web context due to the users <br> having to scroll up and down, arranging content into columns can, nevertheless, be a useful technique.
            </p>
            <code>
              .main-section {
              column-width: 200px;
              }
            </code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Responsive_design">

          <article>
            <p>
              In the early days of web design, pages were built to target a particular screen size. If the user had a larger or smaller screen <br> than the designer expected, results ranged from unwanted scrollbars to overly long line lengths, and poor use of space.  
            </p>
            <p>
               It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the <br> main techniques you need to know to master it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As more diverse screen sizes became available, the concept of responsive web design (RWD) appeared, a set of <br> practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc.
            </p>
            <code>
              .main-section {
        column-count: 3;
      }

       <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
          <header>while statement</header>
          <article>
            A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
            evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
      
            <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
            statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
            statement following the loop.
      
            <p>
              The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
              the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
              tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
              control is passed to the statement following while.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
              those statements.
            </p>
      
            Example:
      
            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
      
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p>
              With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
              Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
      
            <ul>
              <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
              <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
              true, so the loop terminates.
            </p>

           Save the HTML document and stylesheet into a directory on your computer, and add the images into a folder named images.<br> Opening the index.html file in a browser should give you a page with basic styling but no layout, which should look something like the image seen below.

            A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
            statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
      
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>
                A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                separated by commas.
              </li>
              <li>
                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                brackets, { }.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
            <p>
              The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
              consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
              function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
              specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
              value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
              the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
              the calling function.
