                    On March 9, a seven-member panel presided over by Justice Jones

                        Convener of Fixing the Country Movement, Ernest Owusu-Bempah, has urged the citizenry to disregard claims by the National 
                        Democratic Congress (NDC) the Akufo-Addo-led administration has plunged the economy in shambles. 
                        According to him, there was no truth in the claim, and such comments must be given no attention. 
                        Addressing a press conference in Accra on Sunday, he stated that the country was not the only country going 
                        through economic challenges as every country in the world had various economic crises they were dealing with 
                        as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues like the Russia and Ukraine war.

                        “Funding church projects and activities has been very difficult with limited 
                        finances but the formation of the Generals would provide another source of 
                        funding to undertake important projects like decent places of worship at deprived 
                        areas,” he stated.
