                <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                <p>
                    There are few things worse than taking a computer or laptop 
                    and trying to update it after missing a year or two of patches. 
                    What seems like it should just take a day can take weeks of 
                    frustration trying to get patches to work, operating systems 
                    to recognize changes, and for updates to install without glitches.
                    The above problem, and other common computer maintenance issues, 
                    can be avoided with proper PC and laptop computer maintenance shop.

                <h2>Software</h2>
                <p>
                    Every client downloads the metadata for every update that is not declined 
                    in Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and then tries to scan for compliance. 
                    This is because the main role for WSUS in a Configuration Manager environment 
                    is to provide the update catalog (metadata) and EULAs to the clients.  
                    Every update that is synced from Microsoft becomes part of the catalog whether 
                    you deploy it or not.  This is the reason that syncing the entire product list
                     will crush WSUS into oblivion.

                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware maintenance or hardware support can be thought 
                    of like an insurance policy or a warranty on your laptop. 
                    When you have a warranty on your car, you no longer have 
                    to worry about how much the maintenance and repairs will cost. 
                     Instead, you can pass off the problem to experts who have 
                     the resources that you arenâ€™t likely to have internally and 
                     they will take care of it. Hardware maintenance support can be 
                    provided by the manufacturer 
                </p>
